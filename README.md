# Python Basics â€“ Simple Input Programs

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate how to use variables, take user input, and perform basic calculations. These examples are ideal for learning how Python handles data entry and simple logic.

## About Python

Python is a high-level programming language created by **Guido van Rossum**. It is widely used for developing a variety of applications, including:

- Command-line tools
- Desktop GUI applications
- Mobile apps
- Web development
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Game development
- Cybersecurity and ethical hacking

Python is known for its simple syntax and readability, making it one of the easiest languages for beginners to learn.

### Key Features

- A large standard library with ready-to-use modules
- Clean and readable syntax
- Consistent code layout enforced by indentation
- Support for object-oriented programming

### Variables and Operators in Python

Working with variables in Python is simple:
- No need to declare a variable type
- Variable types are dynamic and can change during program execution
- Assignment is done using the `=` operator

## Programs in This Repository

### 1. User Data Input

A program that prompts the user to enter personal information such as:
- Name
- Address
- Province
- Postal code

The program then displays the input back to the user in a structured format.

### 2. Room Area Calculator

A program that:
- Asks the user to input the **length** and **width** of a room
- Asks for the **unit** of measurement (meters or inches)
- Calculates and displays the **area** of the room

This example introduces basic arithmetic operations and conditional logic in Python.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uwenuen/Python_Basic-Simple_Input_Programs.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. Run the programs using Python:
   ```bash
   python user_data_input.py
   python room_area_calculator.py
