# Python Basics – Simple Input Programs

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate how to use variables, take user input, and perform basic calculations. These examples are ideal for learning how Python handles data entry and simple logic.

## About Python

Python is a high-level programming language created by **Guido van Rossum**. It is widely used for developing a variety of applications, including:

- Command-line tools
- Desktop GUI applications
- Mobile apps
- Web development
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Game development
- Cybersecurity and ethical hacking

Python is known for its simple syntax and readability, making it one of the easiest languages for beginners to learn.

### Key Features

- A large standard library with ready-to-use modules
- Clean and readable syntax
- Consistent code layout enforced by indentation
- Support for object-oriented programming

### Variables and Operators in Python

Working with variables in Python is simple:
- No need to declare a variable type
- Variable types are dynamic and can change during program execution
- Assignment is done using the `=` operator

## Programs in This Repository

### 1. Personal Introduction Program
This simple interactive program collects basic personal information from the user through a series of text-based prompts. Specifically, it asks for:
- The user's name
- Their hometown or place of origin
- The name of their previous school
  
After collecting the data, the program displays short, conversational responses using the provided input to simulate a friendly introduction. This exercise helps beginners understand how to work with user input, string concatenation, and output formatting in Python.

### 2. Room Area Calculator
This program calculates the area of a room based on user-provided dimensions. It prompts the user to enter:
- The length and width of the room (as floating-point numbers)
- The unit of measurement (either meters or inches)
  
It then calculates the area and displays the result in the appropriate unit. If the user chooses "inci" (inches), the program converts the result using a basic factor from meters to inches (1 meter ≈ 39.3701 inches).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uwenuen/Python_Basic-Simple_Input_Programs.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. Run the programs using Python:
   ```bash
   python user_data_input.py
   python room_area_calculator.py

## Author
A simple project created during practicum sessions for the Algorithm course, aimed at learning the basics of Python.
